# Hello World!
==============
Who is Nineball anyway? Well, you might say I'm just an just old dog learning new tricks. My alias, Nineball, is a takeoff on Donald Sutherland's handle, Eightball, when he co-starred with Clint Eastwood in the famous WWII flick. As Eightball said when his army tank broke down, "I just drive the thing, I don't know how to make it work." So here, I'm developing a working skill at using Github (and SASS); and this account was set up for trying out new stuff along those lines.
 
I've always worked alone in the past, so I'm not at all sure how this project will turn out. All useful suggestions for making these tools work right are appreciated.
