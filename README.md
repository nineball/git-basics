# Hello World from Nineball
Just who is Nineball anyway? Well, you might say I'm just an just old dog learning new tricks. My alias, Nineball, is a takeoff on Donald Sutherland's handle, Eightball, when he co-starred with Clint Eastwood in a famous WWII flick. As Eightball once said when his army tank broke down, "I just drive the thing, I don't know what makes it work." So here I am, trying out my skills with Github (and SASS).
 
I've always worked alone in the past, so I'm not at all sure how this project will turn out. All useful suggestions for making this stuff work right are appreciated.
