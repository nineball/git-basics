# Hello World!
==============
Who is Nineball anyway? Well, you might say I'm just an just old dog learning some new tricks. Nineball is my alias because I am a novice at Github (and SASS), and this account was set up for trying out new ideas, including learning to fork and make pull requests.
 
I've always worked alone in the past, so I'm not at all sure how this project will turn out. All useful suggestions for making the collaboration tools work right are appreciated.
